    <h1>i hate software</h1>
    <div>
      this is a page where i collect annoying problems me and my friends
      encountered while using software. be sure to create a pr if you see
      something missing ðŸ™‚

      <h2>windows</h2>
      <h3>virtual desktop touchpad</h3>
      when i try to switch virutal desktop by swiping 4 fingers on touchpad,
      sometimes i start with only 3. then when i add a 4th one the usual
      desktop switching "animation" activates, but it teleports me back to
      where i started and switches to different window (swiping 3 fingers
      activates "alt+tab", which i never use on purpose). it is like 5%
      of my interactions with this function. not only i need to try switching
      again but also the original desktop displays other window than i want.
      <h3>taskbar gap</h3>
      <p>
      on my win10 laptop there is a single pixel under the taskbar that
      prevents me from moving my mouse all the way down when trying to switch
      to different window (i use small taskbar icons with enabled labels
      so they're supposed to be easy to select with little precision).
      it just doesn't click them; i have to move my mouse up a little.
      </p>
      <p>
      i just fixed it by toggling auto hide taskbar on and off XDD<br>
      let's see if it caries over after restart...
      </p>

      <h2>spotify</h2>
      <h3>maximize</h3>
      win+up doesn't maximize a spotify window if it's too big. exact reason
      tbd (it does work on "stock" win11, didn't check with explorer patch i
      use tho).
