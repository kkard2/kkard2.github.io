      <h2>windows</h2>
      <h3>virtual desktop touchpad</h3>
      <p>
      when i try to switch virutal desktop by swiping 4 fingers on touchpad,
      sometimes i start with only 3. then when i add a 4th one the usual
      desktop switching "animation" activates, but it teleports me back to
      where i started and switches to different window (swiping 3 fingers
      activates "alt+tab", which i never use on purpose). it is like 5%
      of my interactions with this function. not only i need to try switching
      again but also the original desktop displays other window than i want.
      </p>
      <div>
        also, before someone accuses me of using a mouse: this is not using
        a mouse.
        <ol>
          <li>this is a gesture not a mouse movement</li>
          <li>
            it's literally faster to move my right hand from home row to the
            touchpad than moving my left hand to ctrl+win and my right hand
            to right arrow. of course, i wouldn't have this problem if i
            used linux and you can critisize me for that.
          </li>
          <li>
            yes i know i have ahk shortcut for that i don't use it
          </li>
        </ol>

      <h3>taskbar gap</h3>
      <p>
      on my win10 laptop there is a single pixel under the taskbar that
      prevents me from moving my mouse all the way down when trying to switch
      to different window (i use small taskbar icons with enabled labels
      so they're supposed to be easy to select with little precision).
      it just doesn't click them; i have to move my mouse up a little.
      </p>
      <p>
      note: this actually is using a mouse
      </p>
      <p>
      i just fixed it by toggling auto hide taskbar on and off XDD<br>
      let's see if it caries over after restart...
      </p>
      <p>
      update: it does not
      </p>
      <h3>recycle bin</h3>
      <p>
      apparently i can't open recycle bin without a desktop icon (by "normal"
      means). i need to win+r <code>shell:RecycleBinFolder</code>. wow.
      </p>
      <p>
      unrelated note, why can't i preview folder contents in recycle bin?
      i need to restore it? what if i don't want to restore it in the same
      place or there are new files with same names already?
      </p>

      <h2>spotify</h2>
      <h3>maximize</h3>
      <p>
      win+up doesn't maximize a spotify window if it's too big. exact reason
      tbd (it does work on "stock" win11, didn't check with explorer patch i
      use tho).
      </p>
      <p>
      update: spotify checks if it's maximized by comparing window size to
      screen size. so if it's bigger than available space (which is easy to do
      on windows and happens automagically on my laptop) it won't maximize.
      </p>
      <p>
      update 2: no it doesn't. i managed to make it not work just now but i
      can't reproduce it. epico.
      </p>
      <h2>git</h2>
      <h3>uninstall</h3>
      <p>
      after uninstall i was left with a few files in
      <code>C:\Program Files\Git</code> (guess how i found out about no recycle
      bin thing)
      </p>
      <p>
      also, i uninstalled it because ssh auth stopped working for some reason.
      that might be my bad tho so it's not included in this list.
