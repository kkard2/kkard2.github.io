<p>
i'm pretty much done with setting up rss. overall, this presented a few
challanges because of my previous <a href="/software">/software</a> setup,
but i managed. i even had a great time constructing a macro (vim btw)
for converting <code>&lt;!-- #include ... --&gt;</code> into rss items
(trying to convert register contents into readable form to paste here proved
to be too difficult for me; i assure you it's impressive).
</p>
<p>
and yes, i wrote <code>&lt;!-- #include ... --&gt;</code>. if you look at
<a class="wrap" href="https://github.com/kkard2/kkard2.github.io/blob/41fbd8a8d946c47d7c2ea1a1cc1656279a85aff3/src/software/index.html">
    the source of the <span class="nowrap">/software</span> page</a>
you'll find these #include directives. they are expanded by
<code>deploy.py</code>. fortunately <code>deploy.sh</code> had to go because
i could not get <code>awk</code> commands generated by chatgpt to work.
</p>
<p>
i had to do it this way because i like the current format of
<a href="/software">/software</a>, but rss feed needs a separate page for every
post. i mean, i didn't need to go deeper into my bespoke way of generating the
site; i could've just used some "normal" solution, but i like the control i
have this way (translation: this has no real advantages and i'm inhaling huge
amounts of copium).
</p>
<p>
anyway, you can find exact links at <a href="/rss">/rss</a>: for both
<a href="/blog">/blog</a> and <a href="/software">/software</a> rss feeds.
