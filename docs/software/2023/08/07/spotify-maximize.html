<h3>spotify maximize</h3>
<p>
win+up doesn't maximize a spotify window if it's too big. exact reason
tbd (it does work on "stock" win11, didn't check with explorer patch i
use tho).
</p>
<p>
update: spotify checks if it's maximized by comparing window size to
screen size. so if it's bigger than available space (which is easy to do
on windows and happens automagically on my laptop) it won't maximize.
</p>
<p>
update 2: no it doesn't. i managed to make it not work just now but i
can't reproduce it. epico.
