<h3>windows virtual desktop touchpad handling</h3>
<p>
when i try to switch virutal desktop by swiping 4 fingers on touchpad,
sometimes i start with only 3. then when i add a 4th one the usual
desktop switching "animation" activates, but it teleports me back to
where i started and switches to different window (swiping 3 fingers
activates "alt+tab", which i never use on purpose). it is like 5%
of my interactions with this function. not only i need to try switching
again but also the original desktop displays other window than i want.
</p>
<div>
    also, before someone accuses me of using a mouse: this is not using
    a mouse.
    <ol>
        <li>this is a gesture not a mouse movement</li>
        <li>
            it's literally faster to move my right hand from home row to the
            touchpad than moving my left hand to ctrl+win and my right hand
            to right arrow. of course, i wouldn't have this problem if i
            used linux and you can critisize me for that.
        </li>
        <li>
            yes i know i have ahk shortcut for that i don't use it
        </li>
    </ol>

        2024-04-16: i just realized you can change virtual desktop switching
        to use only 3 fingers, which helped a lot
