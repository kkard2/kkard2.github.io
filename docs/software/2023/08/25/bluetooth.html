<h3>bluetooth</h3>
<p>
in windows 10, there is no visible indicator for if the bluetooth
headphones/speaker are connected or not. if you have such a big taskbar
just include some useful information in it please.
</p>
<p>
it's a solved problem. android does this very clearly.
</p>
<p>
of course, there is an icon that tells you if you have bluetooth enabled,
which is very useful /s
