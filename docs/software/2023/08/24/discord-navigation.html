<h3>discord navigation</h3>
<p>
i am slowly getting thru my backlog of annoyances, and one of the old ones
is discord's navigation after clicking tab
</p>
<p>
i really like it, actually. it's a nice way to quickly reply to some
message (way better than clicking a small reply button). you click tab,
up arrow (or in my case <code>capslock+k</code>, long story), then when
you are at the right message you click <code>r</code> and select it for the
reply.
</p>
<p>
the issue appears if you have something typed in for a message. now, up
arrow doesn't work as a navigation tool, but as a means of navigating in
the text box (even if the message is one line).
</p>
<p>
this poses a problem, because i often decide i want to make a reply after
i type everything in (e.g. because chat moved a lot since). my current
workaround is <code>ctrl+a</code>, <code>ctrl+x</code>, do a reply, then
<code>ctrl+v</code> which works, but is annoying.
</p>
<p>
what would be mine solution? just don't take precedence over tab
navigation, you can literally click escape to make your text editing things
