<h3>youtube's watch later again</h3>
<p>
i have ~1.2k entries in the watch later playlist. i just don't feel like
removing videos after watching them.
</p>
<p>
at some point, videos stop getting added to the playlist. when i remove
a few old, watched videos they immediately appear (even if i added them few
days earlier).
</p>
<p>
i've reaserched the topic and apparently yt playlists have a hard limit set to
5000 entries, but:
<ol>
    <li>i don't have 5k videos (unless counter lies to me)</li>
    <li>this limit is quite low, for what i assume no good reason</li>
</ol>

    <!-- why does this need to be inside p, i need to change that -->
    <p>i did not forget about this site. i'm just lazy.</p>
