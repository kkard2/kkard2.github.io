<h3>locked out</h3>
<p>
my head hurts and i should rest instead of writing html but this makes me
insane.
</p>
<p>
i have a xiaomi phone with their goofy ahh miui thing. i don't know if
that's important but i'm clarifying this.
</p>
<p>
i have a "second space" or whatever that is in english set up. so, when i'm
drawing a symbol, i can choose between two "accounts", depending on what
i draw.
</p>
<p>
for some unbeknownst to me reason entering wrong symbol A SINGLE TIME locks
me out from "second space" 30 seconds, even if i unlocked my phone with
fingerprint sensor before locking it. this makes entering "first space"
impossible.
</p>
<p>
so, if normally i unlock my phone with this sensor, and for some reason it
doesn't work (it happens more often than it is acceptable), and i fail my
first attempt at unlocking it normally i am locked out for 30 seconds.
</p>
<p>
unless i get the fingerprint sensor to work.
</p>
<p>
NEVERMIND IT HAPPENS EVEN IF I UNLOCKED FIRST SPACE WITH SYMBOL, IT JUST
LOCKS ME OUT EVERY TIME FOR 30 SECONDS UNTIL I LOG INTO THE SECOND ONE
</p>
<p>
how is this acceptable ux.
