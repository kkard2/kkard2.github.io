<h3>github mobile</h3>
<p>
github's ux team made the decision (or didn't, it may as well have been
left to an implementor's interpretation) to not include "copy to clipboard"
button when sharing a link.
</p>
<p>
why would anyone copy a link to the clipboard on the mobile device? clearly
a useless feature.
</p>
<p>
for anyone wondering, the workaround is to share it to some app and copy it
from there.
