<h3>discord hates user experience</h3>
<p>
check out the following recipe for system usability disaster:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>have 2 maximized windows on 2 monitors; discord on the right</li>
    <li>focus discord</li>
    <li>
        move your mouse to the left monitor, and try to "snap" to the top-right
        corner of the screen and "click the close button"
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
now, what's the result? you somehow moved the discord window from the right
monitor to the left one (and didn't close the left window).
</p>
<p>
note that closing left window this way works if you have it focued.
