imagine you have a windows 10, and you've opened settings page that lists
bluetooth devices. the list detects the paired devices (for about 1 second
for unknown to me reason) and displays them to you. then, you switch to
another workspace, and go back. all devices disappear and are "searched
for" again.
</p>
<p>
it is even more infuriating, because while the animation of
workspace switch is playing, the list is still there, and it disappears
right at the end.
</p>
<p>
i don't even know what it does while doing it. the list has all paired
devices, regardless if they are on or off, so it must be fetching data via
stupid asynchronous protocol from rest api or some shit like that (even
then it's suspiciously slow). i hate this. just read a file with json and
display it.
</p>
<p>
also, don't refresh it every time i do something, that's
important too.
</p>
<p>
update: it also does this if you minimize the settings window
</p>
