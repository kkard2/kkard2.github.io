<h3>explorer.exe: try to get to user directory challenge (impossible)</h3>
you are just unable to get to your home directory easily.
these are the workarounds you can use:
<ul>
    <li>
        win+r <code>%userprofile%</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        <code>%userprofile%</code> in explorer address bar
    </li>
    <li>
        just going into <code>SystemDrive:\Users\username</code>
        (you can get into drive view by default if you change explorer's
        settings)
    </li>
    <li>
        win+r <code>wt</code> -&gt; <code>start .</code> (this is my
        favorite)
    </li>
    <li>
        pin user directory to quick access (i never use that even tho i have
        it pinned)
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
unrelated note: entering <code>~</code> in explorer address bar will
open the browser with <code>~</code> as the url
</p>
<p>
related note: you can't just enter documents folder (which is in quick
access by default) and go one directory up. it doesn't work. for no
reason.
