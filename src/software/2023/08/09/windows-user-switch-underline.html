    <h3>windows user switch underline</h3>
    win11 has a colored underline under the password field when switching
    users. it's supposed to have a color of the selected user's accent
    color, but you can break it by:
    <ol>
        <li>logging out</li>
        <li>clicking on other user</li>
        <li>clicking on the user you logged out from</li>
    </ol>
    now it is colored with the other user's accent color.
