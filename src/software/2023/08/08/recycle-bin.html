<h3>recycle bin</h3>
<p>
apparently i can't open recycle bin without a desktop icon (by "normal"
means). i need to win+r <code>shell:RecycleBinFolder</code>. wow.
</p>
<p>
unrelated note, why can't i preview folder contents in recycle bin?
i need to restore it? what if i don't want to restore it in the same
place or there are new files with same names already?
