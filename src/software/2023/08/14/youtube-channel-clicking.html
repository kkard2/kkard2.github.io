<h3>youtube channel clicking</h3>
<p>
there is this nice feature on the youtube websites that lets you click
on the channel name right under the video title that redirects you
to it instead of playing the video. for some unknown reason you can't
do that for recommended videos on the right side of the player. you may
think "obviously, that's because it's smaller!" but compare the size with
the ones in a playlist...
