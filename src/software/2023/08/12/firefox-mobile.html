<h3>firefox mobile's very questionable design choice</h3>
<p>
i don't know if it's a bug or not, but for the love of god why does
unfocusing the address bar clears text i've been writing? it is insane;
especialy since os update ADDED SOME STUPID SPACE UNDER THE KEYBOARD
I KEEP CLICKING BY ACCIDENT. yes, it hides the keyboard. there is a small
arrow on the left side of the screen below keyboard, but it doesn't
matter where i click. even if it's sligthly below the "enter" button.
