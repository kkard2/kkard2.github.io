<h3>windows taskbar gap</h3>
<p>
on my win10 laptop there is a single pixel under the taskbar that
prevents me from moving my mouse all the way down when trying to switch
to different window (i use small taskbar icons with enabled labels
so they're supposed to be easy to select with little precision).
it just doesn't click them; i have to move my mouse up a little.

<p>
note: this actually is using a mouse
</p>
<p>
i just fixed it by toggling auto hide taskbar on and off XDD<br>
let's see if it caries over after restart...

update: it does not
