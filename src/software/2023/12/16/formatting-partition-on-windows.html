<h3>formatting partition on windows</h3>
<p>
when i tried to format a partition via file explorer, i was left with the
following mess:
</p>
<p>
<code>
    Program Files\<br>
    WindowsApps\<br>
    XboxGames\<br>
    .GamingRoot<br>
</code>
</p>
<p>
a few tries later (it did nothing) i was about to live boot to linux like a
normal person, but just before that i tried "disk management" which worked.
</p>
<p>
we love you explorer.exe, never change<br>
<del>seriously never change, i hate the new ui don't make it even worse</del>
</p>
