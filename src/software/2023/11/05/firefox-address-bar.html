<h3>firefox address bar (or whatever that's called)</h3>
<p>
you can focus the "address bar" by hitting ctrl+l. the issue is that
sometimes it selects all the content, but other times it does not, so
additional ctrl+a before typing is needed (maybe i should remap ctrl+l
to ctrl+l -&gt; ctrl+a in ahk when ff is focused).
