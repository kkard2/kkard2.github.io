<h3>github auth</h3>
<p>
some actions on github require authorization with a second device. the default
action is to request it from the mobile app; you get a notification that you
can click and put digits displayed on the site.
</p>
<p>
however most of the time when i click this notification i get
"no verification requests found" and i need to fumble with alternative
verification methods.
