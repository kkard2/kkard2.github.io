<h3>discord mobile</h3>

<p>
as programmers, we often feel the need to rewrite legacy code. this is supposed
to make the code "better" - either by enabling easier development of features
or improving performance and/or stability.
</p>
<p>
so, discord's mobile rewrite did not in fact accomplish both of these goals.
application is noticeably slower, ux is arguably worse, and sometimes opening
an image results in an unimaginable ui disaster.

i've heard that they want to redesign the desktop app. i'm scared.

    btw you can't delete search criteria (e.g. has: link) if you have some text
    to search entered. (yes i did notice that right now)
