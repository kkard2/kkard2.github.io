<h3>buttons are not links</h3>

<p>
some sites assume you don't use your web browser. for today i don't take issue
with performance (i mean i do but this post is not about this), but with the
use of "spa" architecture.
</p>
<p>
on web pages we have this neat concept called "links". you can click them, and
then you "follow" them. but, you can also use middle mouse button to follow
them in a new tab.
</p>
<p>
frontend developers sometimes don't bother with supporting that behavior.
for example, if you are viewing a channel on youtube you can't open "videos"
"tab" in another browser tab. which annoyed me more than once (i'm a heavy tabs
user).
</p>
<p>
something even more egregious is not allowing more than one instance of a site.
it maybe makes sense in the context of banking apps, but there is literally no
reason to not allow that on a certain polish train ticket selling site.
</p>
<p>
in the case of youtube let's hope it doesn't spread to recommended videos.
