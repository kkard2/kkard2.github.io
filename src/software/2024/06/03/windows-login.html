<h3>windows login</h3>
<p>
i am currently locked out of my "local" windows account.
</p>
<p>
i have it connected to my microsoft account (a terrible blunder) and after a
while of inactivity (i use linux btw) it asked me for "microsoft account
password".
</p>
<p>
which would be perfectly fine (besides the not fine parts) if it accepted my
password. i actually logged into a browser just to be sure and yeah, i am
typing it properly, windows lies to me and doesn't accept it.
</p>
<p>
idk when i'll fix this, but for now i exclusively use arch btw
</p>
