<h1>unhealthy spaghetti</h1>
<p>
a few years ago i've watched a documentary about a person that died of food
poisoning (tw: food poisoning). they've left some spaghetti on the table for a
night and their roommate put it in the fridge in the morning. they didn't find
the taste concerning (i also wouldn't) so they've died.
</p>
<p>
this has nothing to do with the following but has to do with spaghetti.
</p>

<h2>preface (wip title)</h2>
<p>
i very much enjoy building systems commonly referred to as "spaghetti", even if
i'm aware of unpleasent consequences it will put me in the future.
</p>
<p>
for example, i've recently played factorio with a few friends and had to
transport oil from one end of the base to another. if not for watchful eye of
one person it would've been done by barrelling the liquid at extraction site,
putting it in the logistic network and unbarrelling at a place where it was
used.
<del>
    i've managed transporting green chips to red chips production input by
    logistic robots tho.
</del>
</p>
<p>
but of course, this term is also used to describe systems related to my
profession. putting actual job aside (not because i ship such code ofc) in my
hobbying i've created quite a few software "solutions".
</p>
<p>
one instance of "solution" crafting led me to the creation of static
site generator for this website.
</p>

<h2>i don't like javascript</h2>
<p>
specifically how it's used. i mean, also the language, but mostly how it's
used.
</p>
<p>
there <strong>are</strong> valid uses for javascript. however most (i am
exaggerating a lot) sites choose to make it a lazy loading hell. oh well.
</p>
<p>
i've decided not to use javascript for this site for as long as i can. i've
also decided not to rely on some bloated markdown static site generator.
</p>
<p>
so i've rolled out my own.
</p>

<h2>actual start of the content?</h2>
<p>
clarification: i'm not using markdown. i'm rawdogging html+css stack like our
ancestors did. but there is one issue; html+css has some limitations
(limitations is plural because there are actually multiple issues).
</p>

<h3>#include &lt;iostring&gt;</h3>
<p>
i've touched upon this in the previous post, but i didn't clarify how scuffed
the parsing is. to reiterate, i can do something like this in my html code:
</p>
<div class="scroll-container">
    <code class="nowrap">
        &lt;!-- #include software/2024/02/03/paint.html --&gt;
    </code>
</div>
<p>
but how is that parsed?
</p>
<div class="scroll-container">
    <code class="block">for line in source:
    if '&lt;!-- #include' in line:
        include_file = line.split('&lt;!-- #include')[1]
        include_file = include_file.split('--&gt;')[0].strip()
        include_path = os.path.join(start_dir, include_file)
        with open(include_path, 'r') as include_content:
            content += include_content.read()
    # ...
    else:
        content += line</code>
</div>
<p>
yeah, i just check if a line includes <code>&lt;!-- #include</code> and do a
few splits. so, if for example closing the comment is done in a separate line
it just crashes (this is a reocurring theme in the script).
</p>

<h3>template&lt;typename T&gt;</h3>
<p>
so, every page has this nice navigation header at the top, and it would be
pretty wet if i copy-pasted it to every html file i write. that's why i use a
template file:
</p>
<div class="scroll-container">
    <code class="block">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;##title##&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/style.css"&gt;
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;header&gt;
            &lt;a href="/" class="filesystem-root"&gt;/&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="/software"&gt;/software&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="/blog"&gt;/blog&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="/rss"&gt;/rss&lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;a href="/people"&gt;/people&lt;/a&gt;
        &lt;/header&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;
            ##content##
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code>
</div>
<p>
i will not dwell on it because it's pretty self explenatory: just paste files
in the place of <code class="nowrap">##content##</code> and change the title to
file path (if it's not overriden by
<code class="nowrap">&lt;!-- #title actual title --&gt;</code>
</p>

<h3>shiny new stuff</h3>
<p>
you can now click every <code class="nowrap">&lt;h1&gt;</code>,
<code class="nowrap">&lt;h2&gt;</code> and
<code class="nowrap">&lt;h3&gt;</code> tag! this will create a link to the
specific part of a page. surely there is greater than zero probability that
this will be used by someone in the future, right?
</p>
<p>
regardless, i don't think i need to explain how it works. yes, you need the
entire heading to be in a single line. yes, it will break if you have any class
applied to the heading. i hope that's what everyone expected - just don't do
those things! :d
</p>

<h2>what else?</h2>
<p>
oh yeah, i got rid of <code class="nowrap">docs/</code> directory from the
source control. for some reason copying random code from the internet and
pasting it into github workflow worked.
</p>

<h2>:qa</h2>
<p>
you can see the <code class="nowrap">deploy.py</code> in it's full glory
<a href="https://github.com/kkard2/kkard2.github.io/blob/678d5e19f3716835c525791477b0a883db4319eb/deploy.py">here</a>.
<p>
also, i just realized how cool my screen looks right now, so this is the last
thing in the real part of the post you will see (clickable):
</p>
<div>
    <a href="/res/blog/vim-btw.png" target="_blank">
        <img style="max-width: 100%;" src="/res/blog/vim-btw.png" alt="very cool image of vim with 3 windows opened running on arch btw in unstyled i3 session">
    </a>
</div>

<aside>
    <p>post scriptum (unreal part of the post)</p>

    <p>
    it took me 2 months, but i kept my promise. reading friends' sites was
    quite a motivation, surprisingly, and it was fun to write. maybe next time
    will be sooner? (like that's ever going to happen)
    </p>
    <p>
    also, reading the complete post reveals to me that writing is kinda dry,
    but it's probably lack of experience. maybe it will improve if i keep doing
    this :copium:
    </p>
